# neuralBench

A framework to compare the performance of Haskell libraries for artificial neural networks. It is designed to easily add new libraries and tests.

## Libraries

### Used

* [criterion](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion)
* [csv](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/csv)

### Tested

* [HNN](https://github.com/alpmestan/hnn)
* [HFANN](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hfann)
* [neural-haskell](https://code.google.com/p/neural-haskell/)

## Reports

The [reports](/reports/) folder contains the criterion reports calculated on this machine:

* Intel Core2 Duo E8400 @ 3.00GHz
* 10 GB DDR3 RAM
* Windows 7 Professional x64 SP1

## Test Data
* Simple XOR
* [Qulity of red wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
* [Spam clasification](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase)
